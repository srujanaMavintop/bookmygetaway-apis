# BookMyGetaway
BookMyGetaway is a group travel planning and expense coordination platform that helps friends plan trips together without confusion. It enables real-time itinerary collaboration, shared expense tracking, and transparent contribution management. Users can collectively build trip plans, split costs fairly, and pay through a pooled UPI-based contribution feature called “Journey Jar.” The platform also includes secure Google OAuth login and a Node.js backend with session-based authentication to ensure data consistency across all participants.
